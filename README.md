# Mercado Libre Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce site in Latin America. The goal is to examine search traffic patterns, understand seasonality, relate search traffic to stock price patterns, and develop a time series model with Prophet to predict future trends.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Google Search Traffic**: Identify unusual patterns in hourly search traffic and link these patterns to financial events.
- **Examine Seasonality in Search Traffic**: Determine the time of day, day of the week, and weeks of the year that show peak search traffic.
- **Correlate Search Traffic with Stock Prices**: Explore the relationship between search traffic and stock price movements in the first half of 2020.
- **Develop a Time Series Model with Prophet**: Forecast future search traffic trends and analyze its components.

## Data Sources
- Google Search Traffic Data (Hourly)
- Mercado Libre's Stock Price Data

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Prophet for time series forecasting
- Git and GitHub for version control
